 **I’M IN LOVE WITH MY COMPUTER BF <<<3333** ꒰✩ ’ω`ૢ✩꒱


in the digital era, almost everything that's available IRL is also available in the online world + hot dudes aren't exempt from that. 
u heard me- i am ONE breakdown away from constructing the manic pixie dream boy that haunts me ever since i watched 500 days of summer. or, at least something like that. 

u see, as computers have evolved over time, it's only becoming more + more apparent that all the crazy awesome human stuff that human beings do, has now become recorded in the infinite archives of computing history. alongside that, however, is all the crazy sad, maybe a little pathetic, human stuff that human beings also do. significantly less awesome yet recorded all the same. 

that's where MY point comes in. ☆(＃××)

for better, or for worse, we were introduced to dōkyūsei in 1992, forever changing the way that many would go on to view romantic and sexual interaction with others. the first dating simulator game created in japan. despite relying heavily on events as opposed to dialogue with the in-game characters, it is regarded by many as the daddy of contemporary dating simulations. 

we've now gone on to have developed dating sims that seem to get only more vulgar and disconnected to reality as we progress. it makes one wonder how much of this shit is really being taken seriously by members of society. 

i'll admit, the charming pixels on my phone asking me about my day and whether i'd eaten yet were EXTREMELY welcomed by a 14yr old dev, but 19yr old dev can only begrudgingly look back in shame. these game devs really had me thinking ppl gave a fuck about my wellbeing. (ʘ言ʘ╬)

i want to propose the idea of a conscious AI that learns as it converses from you, to create a true reflection of urself. someone, or rather something, that you can talk to at the end of the day that retains the rush of talking to a real person. the currently technology used for dating sims involves preplanned Q&A's, not leaving much space to elaborate on other topics of conversation. this can result in expectations from other real life people to live up to these "perfect partner" standards.

with the current introduction of the AI app "replika" i was fascinated to see the way in which this programmed bot talked to people. just like i'm talking 2 u. 0_0

replika uses a form of AI known as deep neural networks or deep learning in order to train itself to talk to its users. siri, alexa and microsoft cortana also use this deep learning technique to process human speech patterns. for all that u know, i could be a bot too. beep boop. or whatever the hell a bot would say. are you in love with me yet, is this working?
